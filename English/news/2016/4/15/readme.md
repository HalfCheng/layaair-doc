#LayaAir, the King of H5 Engine Performance, announced today that HTML5 will enter a period of high-quality products.

2016-04-15

According to industrial data released by DateEye, HTML5 (hereinafter referred to as H5) game users reached 175 million last year, with a number of more than 3,000, which has become an industry outlet with unlimited potential. However, the difficulty of realizing H5 games is the weakness of all CPs. Referring to the development process of end-to-page and hand-to-hand swimming, heavy H5 is the only way for the industry to grow and mature. As the heart of the game, the engine will undoubtedly explode the H5 game industry once it breaks through the technical constraints and realizes the smooth operation of the large H5. The future is immeasurable.

Layabox, the H5 game engine maker, has made breakthroughs in performance, leading the technological development of the H5 industry. And successively launched H5 industry's first large-scale action game "Hunting Blade 2", the first large-scale MMORPG "Drunken Journey to the West", the first large-scale simulation business game "Dream Home" and many other major works comparable to the quality of APP, refreshing the game industry's understanding of H5 quality and technical capabilities.

Layabox Engine MMORPG Masterpiece "Drunken Journey to the West" H5 Edition

After many large H5 games and more than 100 H5 developers repeated testing run-in. On April 15, Layabox's second-generation H5 engine, LayaAir, was officially launched for download. Compared with previous generations of engines, LayaAir has made overall optimization in performance, API, toolchain, etc., smaller, faster and stronger! It is also a super H5 engine that can be separated from the H5 runtime and comparable to the performance of APP. It is unique in the whole industry.

**Four "Only" to Build the Strongest Heart of H5 Game**

Unlike the hand-tour "channel is king", H5 game is in the "technology is king" period. In the past, H5 games were restricted by the rendering performance of canvas, and there were obvious kartons in the bare running experience of large-scale games. As a result, major engine manufacturers have launched runtime plug-in solutions to speed up H5 games, but there are still many problems: the runtime standards and performance of each engine are different, the channels implanted in runtime are less than one third of the total H5 traffic channels, etc.

Nowadays, a group of crazy elite geeks have finally built the H5 naked running engine, LayaAir, which can compete with APP.

   **We can use four unique generalizations of LayaAir engine's anti-heavenly advantages:** 

It is the only one that achieves the performance of APP by naked running of H5 heavy games and has a commercial open source engine for online cases.

The only engine that covers all the current mainstream H5 development languages supports the development of ActionScript 3, TypeScript, JavaScript and ES6 language specifications.

The only IDE tool developed with its own engine can visualize common development environments such as UI, particle, skeleton, map scene and animation, which greatly improves developer's efficiency and optimizes workflow.

The only development is implemented once, and Flash Page Swimming Edition, APP Edition (Android, IOS) and H5 Edition of the full platform engine are released at the same time.

In addition, LayaAir has more highlights: supporting the development of 2D, 3D and VR, and synchronously releasing VR products when developing 3D products, with multiple returns at a time; its core engine library is only about 100K, running memory occupies only about 2M, very light; but its functionality is not discounted, including animation, UI, particles, skeleton, physics, 3D and other systems, but also has support citation. The exclusive advantages of expansion and subcontracting are applicable to advertising, education, marketing and other fields, which can be said to be very strong. LayaAir sounded the trumpet of PK in the same stage of H5 and APP games with its peak strength, which is bound to set off a new wave of one is more in the field of H5 engine.

Long Press Recognition Two-Dimensional Code to Open H5 Game "Dream Home" Experience

Compared with hand-to-hand games, H5 games have more diversified channels, one by one close to a thousand channels for CPs need to consume a lot of time and manpower costs. In addition to providing engines, Layabox also provides one-stop docking and distribution services, covering all the key nodes of H5 game development, distribution and operation, so that the major key links can be efficiently connected, one-time docking, and all channels online. At present, Layabox has covered more than 500 million mobile H5 channel traffic in China and more than 600 million mobile channel traffic overseas.

**VR Fields, Distribution of Billion-Class Markets**

With the increasing popularity of 3D, VR and AI, the storm of cutting-edge technology is being hatched. In the future, a single engine will gradually be replaced. In addition to continuing to improve the LayaAir 2D engine, Layabox has taken the lead in large 3D and VR H5 engines and tool chains. Now it has H5 naked running VR and 3D game DEMO, and is ready for the era of H5 3D and VR games, so as to relieve developers of their concerns about the life cycle of their fields.

H5 games have entered the inflection point of big investment, big production and big income. The advent of LayaAir has brought a bursting impact to the game industry: is it no longer rare for multi-million-level H5 games? Will the dividend harvest date of the H5 game come earlier? All doubts need to be verified urgently. Layabox expects to cooperate with more excellent teams to promote the upgrading and development of the H5 industry and focus on the heavy H5 game field.
