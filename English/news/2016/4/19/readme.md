[TechWeb Report]

In the process of rapid development of the game industry, Duanyou lost its position as "Big Brother" of the industry, and page games also went from brilliance to decline, while hand games suddenly emerged as "sunrise industry", but in this process, there is a special "group" growing slowly, waiting for everyone's attention to focus on it, which has become a huge tree. It's HTML5.

What is an HTML5 game? To explain it in popular words, it means that a link can be opened in a browser or a wechat to have a pleasant game experience. At the same time, you don't need to download and install any client. It is a Web game widely used in mobile scenarios. Presumably, a lot of people have played "Neuro Cat" in the circle of friends. This is a small game developed by using HTML5 technology. While the game industry shocked its three days of over 100 million visits, it also fixed the concept of HTML5 game here. Whenever mentioning HTML5 game, people will think more of those games which were assembled with simple code and material. The picture is very low, the operation is very low, and the experience is also very low. ...

Does HTML5 really belong to the field of small games? As Layabox, which has been devoted to the research and development of large HTML5 game engine since 2011, after years of accumulation and precipitation, it finally broke the ice in 2015 and continuously launched large-scale HTML5 games of APP quality, including the only heavy action game in the industry, Hunting Blade 2, the only large-scale multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), Drunken Westward Journey and the only large-scale simulation in the industry. More than ten large HTML5 games based on Layabox engine, such as farm game "Dream Home", have refreshed the game industry's understanding of HTML5 time and again.

HTML5 Industry Contribution Award 2015

The Layabox engine, which has won many awards such as "HTML5 Best Engine Award" and "HTML5 Industry Contribution Award", has many unknown secret weapons behind it. TechWeb reporter has the privilege to interview Xie Chenghong, the legendary founder of Layabox, who will uncover the story behind HTML5 engine technology.

**The Founder of Web Game Based on Lazy People's Demand**

********

Xie Chenghong: Previously, I attended a cross-year Symposium in which Cheng Wei, a taxi driver, said that China is a big Internet country, but we are not a strong Internet country. Why are we a big country of the Internet in China? Because we have many technicians and the whole dish of the Internet is big, but these can not make us a strong country of the Internet, because the Internet is the innovation and landing of the business model, but we have little contribution in the core of the bottom of the Internet. My pursuit, I am not willing to China's Internet development is the content of bringing doctrine, which is the embodiment of the low-end level. The development of underlying technology determines whether China's Internet will become a powerful country in the future.

To illustrate with a more concrete example, American automobiles have disappeared, but Americans are not worried about it. Why? Because they have started to build the next generation of cars, the advantage is not the embodiment of size. It lies in the investment and investment of future technology, which makes the United States at the forefront of the technological power. From here, we can see that the original technology in China's Internet environment still needs to improve and join more investment, which is why I want to do one of the focus of this enterprise.

I entered the game industry in 1999, and the reason why I entered the game industry was that in 1996 I made an educational game software, which can be said to be an educational software in the way of games. It's interesting to play games. So in 1999, I spent three months alone to make an HTML chess and card game hall. This is the first web game with business model in the world. Finally, I sold it to Haihong, the parent company of Lianzhong. 3 million RMB is my first bucket of gold.

I am a lazy, troublesome person, any download and installation for me, is very disgusting, because these processes are too cumbersome, contrary to human nature. I think science and technology should be more in line with human nature, that is, human nature of science and technology. At the same time, it is also the most basic demand of human nature, which can be called lazy demand.

In 2000, I made a world's largest graphic leisure game platform, and also the earliest page game platform - Cola bar. When the Coke Bar was founded, it was also based on lazy thinking. It was the world's earliest page-surfing platform made of plug-ins. At that time, we used web page technology and plug-in technology to restore the effect of end-surfing. Later, we had 560 million users worldwide. The core of all my entrepreneurship is technological foresight and technological innovation.

How to become a master depends on two factors: the first is realization, the second is reward. But if you put rewards first, it's hard to be a master. People should have dreams. Even if my dreams are unsuccessful, they will have an impact on future generations or what is going to happen. I am also very happy. For me, the driving force of entrepreneurship is actually that I enjoy everything in the process of entrepreneurship, and creating myself brings me great pleasure, and persistence is the most critical to the realization of my dream.

　　我是一个几起几落的人，早期的创业路我是一帆风顺的，我坐拥着金钱和名誉，基本没有受到过什么挫折。产业地位比较高，一些做游戏的都来找我，比如网易的丁磊。搜狐的张朝阳也曾为了一个短信支付业务，半夜打电话来谈合作。但后来，我违背了自己的特点，从2003年开始到2012年我开始走了一个弯路，也是我走向了人生中近10年的低谷。那是因为我放弃了平台，开始做起了端游研发。

Why did I make a detour in 10 years? To be objective, I am not a first-class game producer, I am a first-class programmer. Despite the research and development of a number of top travel masterpieces, such as "Tennis Baby", "Chaotic World", "Hunting Edge", among which "Chaotic World" even attracted the attention of Shengda Chen Tianqiao. He and Li Yu came to me personally to sign products. But after the completion of the game, it was either hidden in the snow, or it was not a good place to call it. I went very rough in the past ten years, which also made me pay for everything I hadn't thought of.

3D End Tour "Hunting Edge"

The last one is "Hunting Blade". Although it has a great influence, the whole end-tour market is on the decline. The most important thing is that the marketing cost of end-tour is increasing continuously. Although the revenue is soaring, the marketing cost is also soaring, which is too high for our developers to bear. I began to think about how to go on in the future. There were several choices before me at that time: paging or hand-surfing. Li Xuemei of 51wan said to me at that time that you were the originator of web games. As long as you do web games, I will invest money immediately. Later, I didn't think either of them were my best areas.

In 2011, I think of a direction, which is the development direction of hand-surfing, PC page-surfing and mobile page-surfing. What kind of technology can bring all platforms together perfectly? Only HTML5 technology can achieve it. It is precisely because of this premise that I join the HTML5 industry. One in the future does not form the direction of the industry, I do, this is what I am good at.

At that time, due to the development of the company and the influence of Duanyou environment, the company began to lay off staff, from more than 300 people to only dozens of people, I had to sell the real estate to pay severance pay to employees. It is not the staff's responsibility, but their own responsibility that enterprises fail to do a good job. I need to shoulder such a responsibility. And my employees, in my most difficult time, also mortgaged the property to the company to pay wages. This is the trust between us, but also the performance of our corporate cohesion.

When I stepped into the industry in 2011, I found that the biggest problem HTML5 faced was at the technical level. The performance and compatibility of HTML5 was the most lethal and malicious thing. But I still want to challenge the HTML5 games. In this way, a large-scale multiplayer online leisure game "Crazy Snowball" of our self-developed engine (Laya) came out in 2012. Even today, this game is still called a boutique, and recently Tencent is chasing us to represent this large HTML5 game which will be completed in 2012.

HTML5 Multiplayer Online Leisure Game "Crazy Snowball"

In 2012 and 2013, we continued to research and develop HTML5 products and engines, developed a large card strategy game "Three Kingdoms Meow" and now renamed "Shangba Master". This product achieves the goal of three-terminal integration. There are App version, H5 version, and also made money on the page, and this 13-year-old large H5 game still has a million-grade month to date. Running water income. Our Laya engine was perfected in 2013 and won the Open Source Award sponsored by CSDN and MIIT. When the engine is perfect, the first thing I think about is open source, so that more people can get such benefits.

In 2014, I proposed a goal to prove that HTML5 can compete with Native APP in terms of technology, presentation and performance. "Hunting Blade 2" is based on such an original intention. Because HTML5 was not popular at that time, developers thought that only Native APP could show high performance in mobile phones, HTML5 technology could only make small game products, and we just want to change this perception, let you know, our Layabox engine HTML5 can achieve the performance and experience of Native. If you want HTML5 to become an industry, you need to be able to compete with Native APP in HTML5 games.

HTML5 Industry's First Heavy Action Game "Hunting Blade 2"

In order to compete with the quality of APP, "Hunting Blade 2" in the production cost, research and development cycle has fully met the standard of APP research and development, is in the leading level of HTML5 industry, and eventually became the benchmark product of HTML5 industry in 2015. After completing the large-scale action game "Hunting Blade 2", we think that Layabox's HTML5 engine technology has matured and can be used to produce large-scale HTML5 games with APP quality, so we began to promote this engine. This is why our engine began to develop in 2011 and came out in 2015.

  MMORPG游戏《醉西游》H5版
****
**On April 15, this year, we released a new and blockbuster product under Layabox, the LayaAir engine.**This is the case. Before that, we launched an engine called LayaFlash. Apart from developing HTML5 games in Flash's AS3 language, the more important feature of this engine is that it can convert Flash pages into HTML5 games. MMORPG "Drunken Journey to the West" is a kind of Flash pages with over 600 million streams and over 100 million players activated to be converted into HTML5 games. But LayaFlash engine has a problem. In order to solve the problem of HTML5 performance, we used LayaPlayer plug-in technology in the early days. At present, dozens of mainstream channels including QQ browser, play bar, Baidu, Sina Weibo, Cheetah and so on have built-in LayaPlayer plug-in. However, compared with the total traffic channels of HTML5, the distribution volume of HTML5 in these channels is less than one third of the total industry traffic. Channel implantation speed is far from our expectations, which greatly restricts the development of HTML5 games and the scale of channel distribution. As a result, we need to build a plug-in without LayaPlayer runner, which can run HTML5 engine naked directly in App such as Wechat. LayaAir was born.****

Layabox uses a large game product to polish the engine before it launches the engine. In other words, it fills in the pit first. If it doesn't, it may pit the developer. LayaAir, the second generation engine, is still the same. We developed HTML5 version "Dreamland" with the developer of App Manor before the engine was released. Now it is on-line testing. You can experience it on Layabox's public account. This is the only HTML5 industry that can run smoothly in Wechat and ordinary browsers without plug-ins. PPP level games.

App-level game "Dream Home" in Layabox Wechat Public

In addition, the 3D era of HTML5 is coming, and the VR of HTML5 will have a lot of room for development in the future. Our engine technology will support it, which is also the driving force for the development of LayaAir. For the advent of the VR era, we will promote it through investment in content. With our technology, we can provide developers with more and better products and content at the lowest cost.

From my point of view, the future integration of HTML5 technology and content fully reflects the advantages of LayaAir, relying on our technology can truly achieve the smooth operation of large HTML5 games, providing users with a better experience. The LayaAir engine makes the creative space wider and manifestations more diverse.

Thank you for your interview with TechWeb and everyone who cares about HTML5 industry and Laybox engine. We will continue to maintain our technological innovation strength and product case to promote the development of HTML5 industry.
