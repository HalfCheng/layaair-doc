_______**No IP is absolutely impossible**

This is an era in which IP is king. According to the data of App Store, whether it is a new online game or Top200, the utilization rate of IP has reached more than 40%.

Top20, on the App Store Game List, has more than 80% IP usage.

This shows that the utilization of IP in China's hand-games market is gradually increasing, and IP is becoming a key factor in the success of games.

This is validated in the comparison of conversion rate and revenue between IP and non-IP games.

As a popular symbol, IP has its own fans halo, which can attract the attention of its own fans. When the number of IP fans is large enough, it can trigger social effects, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of players, attract players to download and pay. Conversion rate and revenue more than twice that of non-IP games are the perfect interpretation of IP value.

At the same time, a good IP can obviously reduce the risk and improve the revenue of channel providers, so more and more channel providers choose to promote IP games first, while non-IP games are ignored.

Under such circumstances, CPs are forced to join the IP army if they want to get better channels.

_______**IP is not omnipotent**

But does it mean that having a good IP can break through the Red Sea?

According to the statistics of AppStore, there are no more than 50 IP hand games that can keep on the bestseller list, and more than 1,000 new ones will go online every month, of which 40% use rate of IP, that is to say, only 10% can really succeed in IP hand games.

In Xie Chenghong's opinion, IP is not the absolute weapon to help hand swim and kill the sea of bleeding. But if there is no IP, it is very difficult to become bigger and stronger in the mobile market. So far, the role of IP is just around the corner.

The so-called foundation is high-quality game products. But it must be pointed out that the development of IP is time-sensitive, and only in the hot IP games, can we maximize the benefits.

Game, literature, animation because of congenital advantages, developers can make every effort to do a high-quality game, while film and television IP is not so good congenital conditions.

Therefore, developers who hold high-quality IP have three essential points to fully tap the value of IP: a full understanding of IP, high-quality game products, and the launch of IP during the hot period.

Only by satisfying these three points can we make good use of IP as a huge weapon and turn it into our own interests.

_______**How to Choose High Quality IP**

So, as a game developer, how to choose IP? Take a look at the App Store data.

Whether Top200 or Top20, game IP occupies the largest market share, followed by literature, animation, film and television, which also reflects the current demand for different IP in China's game market.

End-to-end IP is the well-deserved king of hand-to-hand IP. Fans who have accumulated from Tour Tour will habitually look for games they are familiar with during Tour Tour.

At this time, the game itself is a big IP, as long as developers maintain the level of hand-swimming, can be more successful than other games.

Literature and animation IP often attract a batch of loyal fans because of their long duration and high quality content during the IP formation period. This group of fans is very important for the development of hand games using this kind of IP. It is also a sharp weapon to open up the situation at the beginning of the game, and even can quickly become a financial explosion by virtue of the influence of IP.

However, it should be noted that the development of such IP must be based on a full understanding of IP itself, rather than drifting with the tide, otherwise it will be difficult to succeed.

Movie IP is a new type of IP which has been rising gradually in recent two years. For this kind of IP, timeliness is the key. If you can't launch a game in a movie or TV hit, the revenue will be greatly reduced.

The development of a high-quality large-scale game often takes more than eight months. In terms of the popular iteration time, eight months is too long! When the game is developed, a new wave of video IP appears. Therefore, if there is no smart vision to explore movie IP ahead of time, then in order to carry out the development during the broadcast of film and television, we can only rush to work, and the effect is not satisfactory.

This is why video IP accounts for the least of the four categories of IP. Because not everyone has vision and strength to play video IP.

_______**How to make better use of IP**

So how to make better use of IP? Before answering this question, one more question should be discussed: What is the difference between IP games and traditional games?

The difference between IP game and general game is that besides traditional network channel, IP channel itself is also very important. For example, the website or app for novel reading, film and television animation. These IP-related scenarios are undoubtedly the most attractive for fans to enter the game.

Imagine a two-dimensional code or link with IP when a player is watching a movie or TV play or reading a novel on the Internet. How much will this increase the user conversion rate? What if this is a H5 game that can be played by clicking or scanning?

Therefore, IP games can let fans enter the game quickly under such circumstances. Obviously, H5 games can better meet the fundamental needs of IP games than traditional APP games.

In addition, with the emergence of tens of millions of explosions in Legendary World H5, it is undeniable that IP plays a central role, and H5 as a carrier of communication is a successful case of IP with the lowest cost. The other H5 MMORPG "Drunken Journey to the West H5", with 43.24% of the exposure times and 19.63% of the payment rate, benefits from its 600 million streaming pages and IP base of over 100 million users, as well as players'recognition of the Western Journey IP and MMORPG play. The IP effect is further aided by H5's powerful user conversion and dissemination power. More and more people are beginning to realize that the natural advantages of H5 games on IP are beginning to emerge.

In the future, who has good H5 game development capabilities and high-quality IP resources, who can grasp the initiative of the game market, just as LayaBox can help developers to meet these two points.
