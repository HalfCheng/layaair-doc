##Distribution of Education Industry and Training of Professional Talents in Advance

As a new engine, LayaAir has great ease of use. But it's still a new thing for people who haven't touched the LayaAir engine or even the development.

Learning materials related to LayaBox products will be included in the education plans of member units. In the future, the LayaBox Education Alliance will also cooperate with universities to bring LayaBox products into the college student community.
