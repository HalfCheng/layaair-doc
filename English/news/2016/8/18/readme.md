#Deep Testing: LayaAir H5 Game Engine Nude Running Performance Beyond Unity3D

2016-08-18

The emergence of "Drunken Journey to the West" H5 makes the game industry realize that HTML5 has the ability to implement large and heavy games of the type of MMORPG at APP level. LayaAir, LayaBox's second-generation H5 game engine, also showed performance and data beyond Unity3D, Apple's top engine, at its launch.

But many developers still question whether H5's 3D technology can restore the 3D game experience of Unity3D engine. This paper validates the real performance of LayaAir H5 game engine by analyzing the actual evaluation report data one by one. Each evaluation DEMO will provide two-dimensional code for H5 direct experience, APP source code for Unity3D engine and download address of HD video disk for developers to test and verify in order to ensure the authenticity and validity of this test report.


 



**Information about the test environment**

Hardware: Red Rice 1S

System version: Android 4.4.2 KOT49H

H5 Running Environment: Wechat Software Version 6.3.22

H5 Running Environment: Chrome Browser Software Version 51.0.2704.81

H5 test DEMO using engine: LayaAir

APP Tests DEMO Using Engine: Unity3D


 



**Performance testing standards**

Whether the game product is fluent or not is the core evaluation criterion, especially for large-scale 2D or 3D games such as role-playing, action type, combat type, etc., which require a higher sense of operation fluency. Once the picture carton appears, it will cause the loss of players.

From the perspective of R&D technology, FPS is an indicator of performance evaluation. FPS refers to the number of frames transmitted per second, or the refresh rate. Movies are played at the speed of 24 pictures per second. The principle of image generation is different between games and movies. Game rendering needs a higher frame rate per second to feel smooth. 60 frames is the highest FPS value of the game.



**Comparison of 3D Performance between HTML5 and APP** 

3D game developers are concerned about how many characters can run on the same screen, how many bones can each character allow, and how many triangles can each character allow. The performance breakthrough of LayaAir H5 game engine enables game developers to develop HTML5 games according to the standard of APP engine, supporting low-end mobile phones to run smoothly with more than 150,000 triangles on the same screen. At the same time, LayaAir fully supports the export of Unity3D editor to achieve seamless convergence of development.

In this test case, an average of 50 skeletons were used for a single character, 24 characters on the same screen, and tested in Red Rice 1, a low-end mobile phone, using browsers such as Wechat and Google.

**Test results:**

Twenty-four 3D characters on the same screen. In the environment of Wechat, the FPS index of the 3-D test case of LayaAir H5 game engine running naked fluctuates between 32 and 33 frames.

Twenty-four 3D characters on the same screen. In the environment of Google Browser, the FPS index of LayaAir H5 game engine running naked fluctuates between 38 and 42 frames.

Twenty-four 3D characters on the same screen are packaged into native APP using Unity3D engine. FPS index fluctuates between 37 and 41 frames.

Through the test results, we can see that the 3D performance of LayaAir H5 game engine in Chrome browser environment surpasses that of App, and in Wechat environment, it also has nearly native performance. As for the performance packaged as APP, the following will continue to be tested.

**Performance comparison between LayaAir APP and Unity3D APP**

**As a three-end game engine based on HTML5 technology, LayaAir can release H5, APP and Flash editions simultaneously. LayaAir App version based on LayaPlayer packages has a better performance experience than Native App. Especially in 2D, the performance of LayaAir H5 game engine APP product can even be more than twice that of Unity3D engine APP product.**

In APP test cases, we use 500 character animation + 500 blood strips + 500 words on the same screen, and the overall random speed translation.


 



**test result**

Based on the Wechat environment, the FPS index of LayaAir H5 game engine running naked fluctuates between 23 and 24 frames.

Advantages of LayaAirH5 Game Engine

At the LayaAir 1.0 conference, Xie Chenghong, the founder of LayaBox, stated what he called a fantasy goal: to surpass Unity3D and become the world's top game engine. So is the bottom line for achieving this goal performance only? We will discuss it from three aspects:

**1. Application breadth of products**

Although the Unity3D engine is a well-deserved hegemony of the hand-swimming engine, a new era is bound to give birth to a new field of opportunities. With the technological breakthrough of LayaAir H5 game engine, the technical bottleneck of HTML5 industry has been completely broken, and the research and development of HTML5 products of 2D, 3D and VR can be achieved.**Native**App level, and can achieve a development, Flash, APP, H5 three-terminal co-generation.

So, what's the value of three ends in the end? As a developer of APP Tour, after using LayaAir H5 game engine, not only can we continue to develop APP Tour products, but also can use H5 version as the marketing promotion means of its APP version marketing trial. In this way, we can test sailing in the H5 Blue Sea market. It can also use the H5 click-and-play feature to increase the exposure opportunities of the same version of APP products and guide users of APP products in the H5 trial mode. In addition, more than 100 million user markets of hand-swimming simulators have proved that the demand for PC scenarios of hand-swimming is very strong, and the simultaneous release of Flash version will greatly enhance the user's game experience, and even derive a new way of interoperability of multi-terminal data.

As the engine library of Unity3D engine is very large, it does not support HTML5 version in browser environment, nor Flash version, so the demand of Unity3D engine will gradually shrink in the situation of increasing demand for HTML5 technology.


 **2. Tool Chain of Engine**

One of the important reasons for choosing Unity3D engine is that IDE tool chain is mature. As a new HTML5 industry, it will take some time to polish the tool chain beyond Unity3D engine. LayaAir H5 game engine not only has IDE customized for engine, but also supports a large number of third-party IDE tools, including direct export of resources supported by LayaAir H5 game engine in Unity3D editor tool.

**3. Technical Support of Localization Engine**

Compared with international engines, LayaAir as a domestic engine, online technology support (QQ community), problem feedback and response speed, even door-to-door technical guidance and other aspects, providing engine service guarantee, has obvious advantages of localization. At the LayaAir H5 Game Engine Conference, LayaBox launched the Education Alliance. As the first group of member units, LayaAir H5 Game Engine-related training courses and employment education will be launched soon.
