###Red Sea and Blue Sea in Game Market

According to the data, in the first half of 2016, there were 279 million page users, down 8.7% from the same period last year. The revenue of the page market was 10.6 billion yuan, down 2.1% from the same period last year. The market contraction trend was obvious. Many page manufacturers began to seek transformation. Although the overall revenue of hand-games market is still growing steadily, in 2016 Q2, Tencent Netease and Tencent Netease have increased their market share from 56% in 2015 to 63.5%, an increase of 7.5%. Oligopoly has become a problem that all hand-games practitioners must face, and the development of small and medium-sized CPs is increasingly difficult.

However, there is another picture in the emerging H5 game market. In 2015, the H5 game market will be 200 million yuan, but the industry is generally expected to reach 800 million yuan in 2016, an increase of up to 400%. At the same time, the market has now emerged "Legendary World H5" such a successful game of more than 30 million monthly streams, Tencent "QQ Farm" and "QQ Huateng" star products have also been H5 game, stimulating the overall development of the H5 game industry. It can be said that the H5 game is about to set sail for a new era, which brings not only market share, but also new opportunities in the game industry.

###The Future of Game Industry: Cross-border

The opportunities brought by H5 games are not to let the manufacturers of page and hand games completely transform H5 games, but H5 technology can bring new development models for page and hand games manufacturers. As Xie Chenghong said in his speech, the cross-border three ends based on H5 technology are the opportunities and future of the game industry.

Xie Chenghong believes that the future game will be multi-terminal coexistence, data exchange form, and this concept has also been implemented into the LayaAir H5 game engine, LayaAir H5 game engine can achieve a development of H5, APP, page-surfing three versions of co-distribution, and through the data barriers between the three terminals, to achieve three-terminal data exchange.

For the paging manufacturer, it is easy to develop H5 game by using LayaAir engine and AS3 in the process of transformation, and it can realize the free switching between Flash and H5. It solves the compatibility problem of browser and reduces the risk of technology and operation. For hand-swimming manufacturers, both TS and JS can develop app and H5 games on LayaAir engine, which are comparable to native games. On the one hand, they can gain the incremental market of H5, on the other hand, they can also use H5 trial version to get traffic and open up new marketing ideas.
