##A Summary of Think Dry Goods

2017 is the beginning year of the real outbreak of HTML5 industry. The market will reach 5-10 billion yuan. In 2018, it will grow at a faster rate. As a result, some changes will take place in the pattern of China's game industry, and a small number of new giants and dark horses will emerge.

2017 is a year when HTML5 games are set. However, for many people, HTML5 games are a new field, but not a new opportunity.
The lack of high-quality products, channel impatience and other factors will affect the rhythm of HTML5 game development, will make some people can not reach the expected revenue. The blunt, the speculator, the incompetent will lose a huge opportunity. Companies that address industry deficiencies have the opportunity to become huge beneficiaries in the future.



##channel

Channels will expand dramatically in 2017.

Tencent, Baidu, Ali, Facebook, Kakaotalk and other giants have entered, and other apps access HTML5 game distribution speed has accelerated, will reproduce the flow of PC pages flourishing. However, some channels will be frustrated in this round of attempts due to the shortage of high-quality products, the inadequacy of user attributes, the immaturity of secondary entries, the lack of technology in the browser core, and the lack of operational capabilities.

The huge market of advertisement in page age is affected by the lack of second entrance. At present, it is difficult to share the opportunity of HTML5 directly. How to devote the resources of page advertisement to HTML5 (game) will affect the total market volume and channel competition pattern of HTML5 game. In 2017, a large platform with strong operational and technical strength will be the main channel. How to solve the agglomeration of advertising and long tail traffic from the technology and promotion level is not only a difficult problem facing the industry, but also a huge opportunity for entrepreneurship.
Overall: Advertising solution providers and traffic aggregators in this immature environment, there are tremendous opportunities for entrepreneurship.



## **technology**

The maturity of HTML5 engine technology in 2016 is the basis of the industrial explosion in 2017 and the emergence of high-quality games. The maturity of the new generation of high-performance engine represented by LayaAir has promoted the quality of HTML5 games to keep pace with that of APP games.

The development of engine technology in 2017 is mainly based on the maturity of 3D and tool chain, and there will be no more amazing technological breakthroughs.

With the blocking of Flash plug-ins by browsers such as chrome, PC pages are facing a huge demand for porting to HTML5. The development of HTML5 pages is also a new growth point of engine. The compatibility of Flash and HTML5 on PC in China is facing a complex dilemma. LayaAir's dual versions of HTML5 and Flash can be co-distributed and automatically switched, which will be a better solution for the industry.

With the continuous improvement of technology and product quality, HTML5 game has the competitiveness in the field of Native. A development and release of HTML5 game, PC page tour and Native [hand tour] () will become the normal demand of the industry. Excellent engine in this field or will become the future protagonist.

Due to the simultaneous release of HTML5 and Native, the share of traditional APP engines such as Unity will decline.

At present, the domestic open source engine business model has been questioned by the capital circles. The major engine companies have been forced to become issuers and R&D providers, which hinders the development of technology. How to establish a new mode of symbiosis and co-prosperity? It is a realistic problem that industry needs to think about and solve together. VIP payment services, professional charging engines and tools, joint R&D, sponsorship absorption, and investment in CP may be new areas that engine manufacturers need to explore. In short, the engine industry needs to say goodbye to the current capital-driven model of the false sky, otherwise it will do more harm than good to itself or the industry.

Other peripheral technologies, including advertising plug-ins, embedded game platforms and browser kernel optimization, may be new technology venture opportunities.



## **product**

Influenced by Weixin and other new entry channels that focus on game quality and retention, the diversification of HTML5 game quality and game types will change fundamentally in 2017. More types, more creativity and higher quality games will emerge, thus breaking through the current situation that hang-up ARPG games dominate the world.

Influenced by channel types, game types will be classified into two types: page and hand.

Small and medium-sized channels and public numbers are under the pressure of income, preferring to wash users and fast-earning paging mode.

However, large platforms, such as Weixin and QQ, which focus on players'ecology and strength, will pay more attention to product quality, product diversification, long-term operability, retention and other parameters. They may be more inclined to hand-to-hand mode.

Of course, eventually everyone will come to the day when profits are king, but the process and results will be different.

Both models will be successful, but product layout needs to consider channel characteristics and tendencies in advance.

In 2017, the quality and scale of investment of HTML5 games will increase dramatically due to the impact of the entry of many large-scale R&D enterprises and the exclusive generation of HTML5 games from Weixin and other large channels.

In 2015, the average investment in head products was about 300,000.

The average investment in 2016 is about 700,000 yuan.

In 2017, it will rise to about 1 million, and even more than 5 million projects will be invested.

IP + luxury team + high investment portfolio will be the new normal HTML5 game development.

HTML5 games will come from two kinds of sources: hand-surfing and page-surfing. Porting products need to consider resource download, HTML5 user attributes and other factors. Many products that are transplanted blindly will come back.

Due to HTML5 channel characteristics, a few head products still account for more than 80% of revenue.

Influenced by live broadcasting and business, mobile advertising traffic price has been very high, only high-income products in advertising can have the opportunity.

In product operation, some companies will try HTML5 to guide manual or page tours.



##pattern

2017 is a year of fixed pattern. The biggest gainer is from the flow side, and the second is the excellent CP.

Social APP, game distribution channels will be the king of the pattern.

Advertising monopolist will solve the problem of second entrance or three points of HTML5 game world.

In the field of R&D, the opportunities for new entrepreneurs are not as big as expected, and the window period basically disappears. The traditional large-scale paging and hand-surfing manufacturers have entered the market one after another, squeezing the narrow space for entrepreneurs. But insensitive, hesitant front-line manufacturers may also miss opportunities, just as many page surfers miss opportunities, history is always repeating.

So in the future, the pattern of the game industry will not change as much as that of page-to-hand games. After all, HTML5 is essentially just a spatial expansion of channels. It's still the game between the traffic giants and the R&D giants.



##Entrepreneurship

The greatest wonder of the game industry is the miracle. Under the situation of the giant control panel, there are always black horses such as big ball battle, [snake-eating] () big battle and incredible maze. Those creative, product-obsessed and lonely teams, together with a little luck and capital, always have the opportunity to compete for the Central Plains.



In the first half of 2017, entrepreneurs still have a lot of opportunities due to the slowness of some major manufacturers. How can they become new giants in half a year to one year? Opportunities and challenges.
Entrepreneurial opportunities are divided into channel aggregation and support services, advertising aggregation and support services, product development and distribution.

Channel convergence should be alert to the risk that partners will drop your cooperation when conditions are ripe.

Advertising convergence is not a big opportunity, because the cost of migration is low, the traditional giant will still be the final winner. Among them, Southern enterprises, who have been working in the field of page-surfing for many years and are good at traffic conversion and purchasing, will be strong competitors in this field.

Game R&D is the most likely area for the emergence of black horse. Some original A-level manuscript developers will become the new leader in the field of H5 games if they enter rapidly. Such stories always appear in every change.

There are two ways of R&D and entrepreneurship. One is fast. Before big manufacturers enter, they can win the competition opportunities of HTML5 S products by hand-swimming A-level product quality. The risk here is that inadequate understanding of different channel attributes and HTML5 game features can lead to missed opportunities. Another way to start a business is slow. Whether HTML5 or Native, there's a good chance that slow work will produce high-quality games.
