Small games will build a win-win ecosystem closely linked with App games, and small games will be used as a trial conversion of APP games, become a new channel for sharing and dissemination of APP games, so that users can experience APP without threshold. In the future, users can share small games directly through APP, but also jump back to APP games through sharing small games.
