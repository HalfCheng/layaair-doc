Billiards (also known as billiards) is a popular leisure sport in the world. Tencent billiards is a competitive game based on online matching of real players developed by Tencent Photonics Studio. It uses the 3D technology of LayaAir engine to truly restore the texture of billiards and the sense of balls in sports. Once launched, it is loved by the majority of players. It is understood that the current cumulative number of users has exceeded 15 million, and the number of active users has exceeded 3 million.

Since the launch of Weixin small game, the small game has become more and more popular, the products are more and more abundant, more and more products live more than one million a day. Playing Weixin Games has become a new trend. Based on the relationship chain sharing and play-as-you-go, small games are easier to get new users than APP. Therefore, a large number of APP games have begun the road of technology transplantation, and many app game developers have abandoned the current APP project directly and joined the team of Weixin small game research and development.

The more real and gorgeous picture performance and spatial effect of 3D games are the added points of games, and the mature game industry 3D games are also the mainstream type. In the process of transplanting APP games and technological transformation, the maturity of 3D engine is undoubtedly an important choice standard for R&D manufacturers. At present, LayaAir engine has many mature 3D HTML5 business games and 3D advertising marketing cases, and it is also the only HTML5 game open source engine with 3D business cases in China.

In Weixin mini-games, besides Tencent's Tencent billiards of Tencent Photonics, Xiamen's cruise leisure sports game "Entrapment of Sheep" and personal developer's Parkour game "Parkour Chicken" are all based on LayaAir's 3D engine technology. It is believed that as the trend of transplanting APP Games becomes more and more fierce, more 3D products will appear in the platform of Weixin mini-games.
