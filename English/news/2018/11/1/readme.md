The concept of sharing is not unfamiliar nowadays, but the real meaning of sharing is not too much. At present, many so-called shared economy is that the platform side takes out a lot of new resources to collect fees on the basis of sharing. Therefore, when some new physical resources exceed the actual demand for use, it will lead to waste of resources and capital. Charley believes that good sharing is an effective re-integration of social resources, contributing their idle resources, and enjoying the benefits of sharing other social resources. Achieve the goal of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me". Layabox launched a small game traffic sharing platform, which is exactly the case.



###The Status Quo of Weixin Long Tail Game

In the early stage of Wechat games, the use of Wechat relationship chain for various coercive or induced sharing, which is the flow dividend stage of the savage growth of the game, leading to the impact of the unhealthy development of Wechat ecology. With the standardization of the relevant terms of operation of Wechat, the negative factors affecting the ecosystem of Wechat are being removed, and the traffic (users) of small games are getting more and more difficult. Only a small number of small head game products can be profitable through internal purchasing or through the purchase of advertising traffic realisation. For most small games, they can only be actively or passively handed over to the box (small game platform) agent operation, the purchase flow is absolutely how much to buy and how much to lose business.

Those well-known box traffic owners who have certain flow guarantees usually have certain requirements on the quality of the game. There are not a few small game developers who are not agents and have no capacity to buy. Where should they go for these large number of long tail games?

Since October, the micro-game industry of Weixin has begun to show a cooling trend. Demand for outsourcing of small games has declined sharply, with developers holding one or several long tail games in their hands. Some are disappointed to leave, others are still anxious or hesitant...



###Traffic Sharing Platform without Payment and Sharing

Since October, the micro-game industry of Weixin has begun to show a cooling trend. For those games that can't afford to buy traffic, or can't be represented by a box with traffic, some are disappointed to leave, some are still anxious or hesitant...

As a game engine provider with nearly 500,000 developers, Layabox is also a member of small game development. It understands and understands the painful needs of developers in a timely and profound manner. In order to help many developers without the ability to purchase traffic to get traffic, we launched a small game traffic sharing platform. In LayaAirIDE, the component of traffic sharing pool is integrated, which enables developers to achieve technical docking only by dragging and dropping. By simply submitting game information, they can self-help join the small game traffic sharing platform, thus achieving free access to the traffic! ___________

As the operator and initiator of the traffic sharing platform, Layabox will never charge any fee and share for the developers who participate in the traffic sharing platform. The aim is to build a free and shared ecology of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me".

###What is a traffic sharing platform?

The so-called traffic sharing platform, the nature of sharing is the game users, then how do the game users achieve sharing? Before we understand this concept, let's start with a story of quantity change.

Relational chain sharing transformation, name keyword search optimization, small game exchange, these are several important free traffic sources and operational strategies. Conversion refers to the act of clicking and jumping from one game to another in the form of icon icon in the game through a business exchange agreement between the small game and the small game. Eventually, the two sides will form a new exchange of equal users.

For example, A and B games have about 50,000 daily users. A game brings 10,000 new users to B game. B game also needs to bring 10,000 new users to A game equally. After reaching the agreed new conditions, the two sides closed the entrance successively, thus achieving a reciprocal user exchange.

This cooperation mode is more common at present, because the loyal users who belong to their own games will definitely come back, not their loyal users will flow out at the same time will also be added, and there will be a certain proportion of new users will be loyal users. Therefore, the exchange mode is also one of the mainstream free access modes.

However, this model also has certain limitations, such as A game has only 10,000 days of life, B game has 100,000 days of life, A game can only bring hundreds of users to B game a day, and B game can bring thousands of users to A game a day, which will lead to the gap between B game and A game is not willing to exchange. In addition, how can we find more games of the same level for exchange, which requires greater business resources and contacts, and requires greater energy, especially those long tail games that do not even have 10,000 days of life, how to change?

The principle of Layabox's traffic sharing platform is similar to that of switching. No business contacts, no daily living conditions, no fees or dividends, developers directly log in to the traffic sharing platform to submit the game. Platform only checks whether the technology of traffic sharing components has been realized and the game can run normally, and then can be put on the platform. Even if there are only a few thousand or just online games, only a few dozen new or 100-digit clicks can be contributed to the sharing platform, it will also get the reciprocal or unexpected return of the sharing platform.



###Traffic Acquisition Principle of Traffic Sharing Platform

Long tail games on all shared platforms need access to traffic-sharing components first. With this component, some players can jump to a unified shared traffic pool.（**Star Game Selection**In the shared traffic pool, users enter other games according to the exposure recommendation position and their preferences in the platform. It is equivalent to the secondary allocation of the shared flow pool.

In the initial shared traffic pool, Layabox will put self-developed products and small game products of deep partners into the shared platform, becoming the main contributor of the traffic pool, bringing the initial user source for many new long-tail games and new online games. And Layabox will continue to increase the number of high-quality self-research games, and invite high-quality products to join in, bringing benefits to joining developers, especially early joining developers, will enjoy super-value sharing returns.

With the increase of long tail games on the platform, Layabox traffic sharing platform's big data algorithm and AI algorithm will begin to play a role. The system will calculate the platform traffic contribution and traffic gain based on single user clicks after de-duplication, automatically change and adjust the display position of the small games on the platform according to the net contribution value, and recommend favorite games to users. Make the flow to pay and get eventually to achieve a relative balance. For example, after a game joins the platform, only 500 valid clicks (after de-duplication) enter the platform from the game, while 1000 valid click users enter the platform traffic pool. Then the net contribution value of the game is negative. The display weight will be automatically lowered by AI algorithm, and new or click will begin to decay. If the negative net contribution value is reduced or the positive net contribution value is increased due to the change of display position, the weight of display exposure will increase automatically, and the new additions or clicks brought to the game will also increase automatically. Therefore, the core factor of the display weight in the game depends on the contribution and the net contribution value obtained.



###Data Query of Traffic Sharing Platform

The data of traffic sharing platform is represented in the form of small programs. Opening the operating data of the platform will generate a small program code automatically bound to the background. Developers can open Layabox Shared Data Assistant by scanning the code. In the data assistant, they can query the key data such as the total contribution of the game traffic in the platform, the total access of the traffic, and the available traffic, as well as the total contribution and total access of a single game.



###Basic Support of Traffic Sharing Platform

Layabox Traffic Sharing Platform in addition to login platform after the relevant technical guidelines. Layabox officials also provide docking-related technical support. Guarantee the smoothness of developers in docking and joining the shared platform.

For high quality long tail games, after joining the traffic sharing platform, Layabox will promote the selected games free of charge from time to time through the official public number, QQ group, official website and other channels.

Layabox engine officials can provide free one-to-one engine technical support to game developers who have made special contributions to the development of high-quality games and head games with excellent data if they are willing to contribute traffic actively to support the development of long tail games.

To meet the first group of developers to join the platform, Layabox has taken the lead in bringing out several high-quality small game products to join the traffic sharing pool.（**Star Game Selection**It provides basic traffic guarantee for the first batch of developers who participate in traffic sharing.
