###What is QQ light game?

The centimeter game entrance in the centimeter show and chat window can only be seen after opening the centimeter show function. Sharing news is a fission communication gateway, which has been the main interaction gateway since the beginning of the centimeter game era. The entrance of game center, QQ space game and QQ wallet is an open entrance which is easy to find. Quick launch, similar to the top quick navigation entrance of Wechat games, is a list of QQ light games that have been played, but need to be set up in the background by developers.



###Unfully exploited QQ Light Game Opportunities

QQ Light Game Platform has two business liquidity modes: buy-in and advertising. At present, the advertising flow of the platform has exceeded the total stream purchased in the game, 80% of the active games are connected to the advertising SDK. According to some developers who have access to the QQ light game, under the same level of DAU, the advertising revenue of QQ light game is significantly higher than that of other game platforms. This may be related to the fact that QQ video advertising has no limit on games and is better than other platforms in terms of dividing policy.



In addition, compared with the decentralization of Wechat games, the light game platform of Hand Q is based on the idea of high-quality platform. Based on various handQ entries, the traffic of game users will naturally be more centralized and stable. At the same time, QQ light games are also very encouraging and stimulating fission. For example, the light game platform implements an innovative form of red envelope advertising: developers can attract and accumulate users through B2C advertising red envelope. It is reported that 80% of the games using this B2C red envelope function have achieved ROI of more than 100%, and some individual games have ROI of more than 300%. "For example, if you invest 10,000 yuan, the game revenue can reach 30,000 yuan. It has been proved that through this way of advertising cooperation, the red envelope of B2C is essentially an advertisement, and this kind of advertising investment can get a win-win situation."



At present, 250 million QQ light game users are only Android, if the entry of the future iOS version is opened, it will usher in a wave of explosive growth, so the morning shelf, early benefit, QQ light game is still a channel opportunity in high-speed growth, waiting for further excavation by developers.
