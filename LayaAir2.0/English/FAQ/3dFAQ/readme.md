#Frequently Asked Questions



###3. What tools are used to export the 3D resources of the engine and what are the considerations?

**answer**LayaAir Engine's 3D resources, such as model, animation, etc., need to export FBX format files using 3D production software, 3D max, Maya and so on, then import them into Unity, and install the 3D export plug-in provided by LayaAir in Unity. The latest version is beta5, and the download address is https://ldc.abox.com/load/2.0.0beta5/unityplugin/Layagin Plugin_Airbeta.un. Itypackage

Later updates can be downloaded from the official website, or the connection version number can be modified.

A description of the rules and precautions for the use of plug-ins has been included in the plug-ins.
