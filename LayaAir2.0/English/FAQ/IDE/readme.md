###Cache the Great Rule of Law

When using IDE, developers sometimes report errors, sometimes ignore them directly. Sometimes, you need to restart the IDE to solve this problem. Sometimes restarting can't solve it. At this time. We recommend that developers clean up the cache first. Because most of the cases are caused by caching problems.

####Where is the cache file?

In the help menu of IDE navigation, there is an option called“`打开编辑器本地缓存`As shown in Figure 1. By clicking here, you can jump to the cached resource directory.

When the cache directory is opened, it is shown in Figure 2. If it's a layout problem, you can delete the layout directory directly. If it's not clear what the problem is. It doesn't matter if all the directories and documents you see are deleted.
