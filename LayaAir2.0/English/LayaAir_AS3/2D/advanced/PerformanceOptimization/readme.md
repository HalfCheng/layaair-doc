#Performance optimization of LayaAir engine

LayaAir, as an HTML5 engine, can run on a variety of platforms, including personal computers, mobile devices and tablets. Under the background that the hardware performance of mobile devices is weaker than that of PC, our requirement for performance becomes more important. At the beginning of LayaAir engine design, performance was the first goal, and a lot of performance optimization was done in the engine. The performance optimization document outlines best practices for developers deploying applications through code examples and use cases.

If the developer fails to take advantage of the engine, the final performance experience of the game will be out of the question. Therefore, in the process of making games, it is very necessary to master the skills of game and engine optimization.
