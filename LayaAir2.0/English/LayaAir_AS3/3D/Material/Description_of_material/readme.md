Material quality is the material texture of objects, such as wood, metal, glass, hair, water and so on. Their roughness, glossiness, reflection, transparency, color, texture and other material properties are different.

Most 3D engines have independent material classes for program code control. Material processing is also one of the most important parts of 3D production software. Game art developers often have a sentence that in the production of 3D game scenes, three-point view model, seven-point depend on material.

There are many kinds of materials, including standard materials, multi-dimensional materials, synthetic materials, double-sided materials, ray tracing materials and so on. At present, standard materials are mainly supported in layaair 3D engine.**Blinn Phong Material**,**UnlitMaterail**,**PBRStandard Material**And so on.
