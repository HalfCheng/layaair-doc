#Overview of Mouse Interaction

###### *version :2.1.1   Update:2019-8-2*

In LayaAir 2D engine, the object of 2D display has mouse events for us to use, so it is simple and convenient to write logic. This function is not implemented in LayaAir 3D engine. 3D space is more complex. There are many relationships among objects in space, such as depth, distance, cascade, tailoring, father and son, and the space is changing constantly. Therefore, the 3D engine uses collider, layer and physical ray detection, collision information to judge the mouse.
