###8. Hierarchical Manager:

Hierarchical Manager displays all nodes and their hierarchical relationships in the scene in the form of a tree list. All the content seen in the scene editor can find the corresponding node entries in the hierarchical manager. When editing the scene, the contents of the two panels will be displayed synchronously. Generally, we also use the two panels to build the scene at the same time. Read the Hierarchy Manager section for details.
