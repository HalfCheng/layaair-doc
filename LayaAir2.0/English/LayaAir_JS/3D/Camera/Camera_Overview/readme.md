In 3D games, Camera is equivalent to the eye, through which to see the world, all scenes are rendered through Camera. That is to say, if there is no camera in the scene, then no object will be displayed in the game screen. The camera in the scene can also be placed in the sub-nodes of the scene, such as adding to the protagonist role model, which can also render a 3D picture.

Of course, there are other important attributes of the camera. The functions of the camera are described below. If you need to know more about the interface, you can jump the API:[链接](https://layaair.ldc.layabox.com/api2/Chinese/index.html?category=Core&class=laya.d3.core.Camera)
