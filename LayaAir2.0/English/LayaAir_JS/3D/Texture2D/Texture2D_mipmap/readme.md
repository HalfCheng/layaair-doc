#Texture mipmap

###### *version :2.1.0   Update:2019-5-25*

LayaAir3D is a mipmap that supports texture. When we use MipMap technology for mapping a model, the mapping of the model in the game will adjust the quality of the mapping display according to the distance between the camera and the model.

In LayaAir3D, texture mipmap is turned on by default.

The effect of Plane in the following two motion pictures when it is far from the camera begins to get closer from the distance with the camera.

![] (img/1.gif) < br > (Figure 1) uses mipmap

![] (img/2.gif) < br > (Figure 2) No mipmap is used

The effect of mipmap can be seen from these two moving maps drawn far and near. And when the distance from the camera is long, the effect of texture without mipmap is very poor.
