#Overview of Texture2D

###### *version :2.1.0   Update:2019-5-25*

Texture is a powerful tool to enhance the reality of computer generated three-dimensional images. In the absence of texture, your three-dimensional image tends to look like shiny plastic (Figure 1). With texture, you can make your meshes, particles, and interfaces more vivid as shown in Figure 2. Texture is a picture or film file that you cover or surround an object.
