# Mesh的概述

###### *version :2.0.2beta   Update:2019-4-26*

Mesh refers to the mesh data of the model. The 3D model is made up of polygons, while a complex polygon is actually made up of many triangles. So the surface of a 3D model is made up of many triangles connected with each other. In three-dimensional space, the set of data that constitute the vertices of these triangles and the index data of the triangles is Mesh.
