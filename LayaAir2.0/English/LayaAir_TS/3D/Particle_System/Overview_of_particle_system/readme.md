#Summary of Particle Systems

###### *version :2.1.1beta   Update:2019-8-2*

Particles are mainly used for effects such as smoke, fire and water droplets. A particle system consists of many parts: particle emitter, particle animator, and particle renderer. If you want a static particle system, you can use a particle emitter and a renderer. Particle animators will move particles in different directions and change the color of particles.
