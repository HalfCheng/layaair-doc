在这里讲解下如何在LayaAirIDE2.0中创建自定义脚本。

Right-click folder => Create template file => Create a new file called TestScript.

Then enter our script file name. Here we enter TestScript.

Then let's look at the generated script file.

This is the default script file format that comes with the 2.0 IDE.

**Be careful**The template defaults to inherited 2D Script. You need to modify it manually. If the inherited 2D`Script`Class, when used, it will not be wrong. However, some attributes in 3D scripts will be missing, and unknown errors may occur, so we must pay attention to the foundation.**Script3D**Class.

After amendment:
