##Introduction to Version Management Functions

As for version management, the first way is to add random numbers after links, but in the environment of Wechat, the caching problem is very serious. Random numbers can not effectively solve the caching problem, or there will be page chaos caused by the updated version. Therefore, when LayaAirIDE was released, it added a radical solution to the caching problem, that is, directly rename the file name, the file name is different, and the caching problem naturally does not exist.

###Version management mechanism

When a developer has version management enabled, the file name with hash strings will be automatically generated at publication time, and a version. JSON file name mapping file will be generated at the same time. Automatically associate the actual file name in the code with the renamed version management controlled file through the version management class ResourceVersion. As long as the file with version management is changed, the hash string in the changed file name will be updated automatically when it is released. This is equivalent to calling a new file in the running environment, so there will be no caching problem.

In the process of development, developers do not need to pay attention to what the final file name generated by version management is. Even since LayaAirIDE 2.0 automatically integrates version management class ResourceVersion into the code when creating a project, developers don't even need to pay attention to how to use the ResourceVersion class. They just need to check whether to enable version management in the project release interface when they plan to enable version management.

###Effectiveness of enabling version management

In the project publishing interface, after checking whether version management is enabled, a hash string is added to the file name at the time of publication, as shown in the following figure. If the file has changed, a new hash string will be changed for the changed file name.

The effect shown above is that the bin directory in the development environment is on the left and the release directory after version management is enabled on the right. We can see that the JS file in the JS directory and the PNG image file name in the res directory are all added with hash string.
