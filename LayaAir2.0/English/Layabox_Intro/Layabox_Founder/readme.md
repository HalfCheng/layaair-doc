###Introduction

LayaBox A has raised 100 million yuan since it made tens of millions of dollars selling websites and lost hundreds of millions of dollars in end-to-end travel. Xie Chenghong, who has been in business for nearly 20 years, wants to be the world's top game engine.

Xie Chenghong, CEO of LayaBox: "As a programmer, I want to create something of my own, change something, and influence something in the world through the way of programming."



##Xie Chenghong and his Laya Box

LayaBox is a company founded by Xie Chenghong (hereinafter referred to as Lao Xie) in 2014, which integrates game engine, game distribution, game channel and other fields. It can be said that LayaBox is Lao Xie's rebirth after the "ten-year low".

When LayaBox was founded by LayaFlash in 2014, LayaFlash received tens of millions of angel financing. In 2015, dozens of enterprises including engines, CP, channel platforms, data services and so on in the whole H5 industry chain received financing. There was a heated discussion about when H5 broke out. But until 2016, when the outbreak was delayed and capital attitudes towards the H5 industry became more cautious, LayaBox in June 2016 received a combined investment of Shenzhen Venture Capital, Jin Huifeng and Co-operative Capital in Round A, totaling 100 million yuan. Billions of investments are rare in any field. How did Lao Xie impress investors?



LayaBox has been developing since 2011. In 2015, the first generation of open source engine LayaFlash pioneered the use of Flash AS3 as the development language of HTML5. LayaAir, the second generation open source engine, supports Flash AS3, TypeScript and JavaScript, and supports the development of 2D, 3D, AR and VR games. You can also publish APP Hand Tour, Flash Page Tour, HTML5 Game with one click. If anything will restrict the development of H5, technology must be one of the reasons. Lao Xie saw and solved this problem.



Lao Xie is confident of his team and products. He believes that mobile WEB must be the trend of development. And a lot of traffic is being realized through integration, H5 game is a very good opportunity. LayaBox can solve a key multi-platform publishing problem, greatly reducing costs and improving game performance. At present, Lao Xie plans to build LayaBox into a game Engine-based developer ecosystem. LayaBox has its own runtime, which will be the basis for the development of H5 game ecosystem. In addition to incubators and investments, LayaBox has launched the LayaBox Education Alliance, which will incorporate field frequency-related learning materials into its members'education programs. "Future LayaBox Education Alliance" will also cooperate with major universities to let LayaBox enter the group of College students.





##28 Years of Programmers'18 Years of Entrepreneurship

> "Is entrepreneurship painful? It's hard to start a business, but everyone has different opinions about it."

Today, Lao Xie can be said to be an astonishing comeback after the "ten-year low", but how many people know that he has experienced the heartache, the story behind the success.

In 1988, when most people in China did not know about computers, Lao Xie began to learn to program by himself and became the second generation programmer in China. Today, Lao Xie has written code for 28 years. He said that his previous ideal was to be a technology director because he liked technology so much. In 1998, Lao Xie officially started his own business, and successively founded many companies, from Song lamp company to Coke bar; from "ten-year low" entertainment online to now Laaya Box. Every success and failure, hardship and suffering have become Lao Xie's wealth on his way to start a business. At the most difficult time of starting a business, Lao Xie moved from a high-rise residence to a "slum". Not only invest the investor's money in it, but also lose it. He joked that "after all these years of entrepreneurship, there was only one wife and two children left." Laughter can not hide his memories of that period, perhaps in Lao Xie's own view, that period is not "suffering" but a cherished memory on his way to start a business.

I remember someone once said that the most terrible thing about starting a business is not failure, but loss of confidence. How much is the impact of failure and valley on Lao Xie's confidence? It's not personal experience. I think it's hard to feel it. "At that time, I thought it might be quite easy to come over, but I didn't think it would be ten years." That's how Lao Xie upheld his desire for success, his confidence in himself and his team, and his insistence on his ideal for 18 years has come to this day.

A person who has not succeeded may not have enough abilities; a person who has not failed can hardly really understand himself. Lao Xie's efforts when he succeeds and his persistence when he fails are doomed to succeed again.



##A simple programmer, a craftsman and a craftsman

Eighteen years of entrepreneurship, Lao Xie can be said to have created LayaBox, LayaBox can also be said to have achieved Lao Xie. As a successful entrepreneur, Lao Xie's position on himself is different from everyone's imagination. He positioned himself as a simple programmer, a craftsman and a craftsman.

In the early days of LayaBox engine development, Lao Xie sat in front of the computer every day and wrote code like ordinary programmers in the company, sleeping for no more than five hours on average every day. When I am tired, I rest in the company and wake up to continue working. "What's cumulative, just don't sleep." Lao Xie's perseverance and hard work have become the most powerful catalyst for engine development and the company as a whole.

At the beginning of the success of engine development, Lao Xie did not want to regard it as a "commercial" thing to do, but wanted to share the engine, so that the engine can serve more people and bring them some convenience. "Our biggest dream as a technology company is to help everyone create wealth through technology" to help everyone create wealth through technology. This seems to be a simple sentence, revealing the sincere feelings of being a programmer. When the Game Gyroscope asked LayaBox about his pursuit of his engine,**Lao Xie said, "Our company's greatest pursuit is not to be scolded. As long as we feel that our engine is good, do not Tucao every day we have problems with this engine, we will be satisfied. "**If there are 50 years in one's life that can be dominated by oneself, 28 years can be said to be half of one's life. Lao Xie gave his best time to the program and the code. Every word he said elaborated the programmer's passion and dream.
