##Layabox's Past Life



###I. Core Technology Backbone of Team

Xie Chenghong, the founder of Layabox, founded Zhongyue Online, a 3D end-game research and development company, after selling Coke Bar, one of the three major leisure and entertainment platforms in China to Tsinghua Tongfang for tens of millions of dollars in 2003. When Layabox was founded, the engine technology backbone came from the core members of the 3D end-to-end swimming engine that followed Xie Chenghong for many years. The longest time was more than 10 years. Therefore, the accumulation of deep engine experience has laid the foundation for the rapid development of Layabox engine and the direction of 3D engine development.

###2. Origin of HTML5 Engine Research and Development

At the same time, Xie Chenghong, the founder of Layabox, set up LAYA Laboratory at the end of 2011, and began to research a general engine that can publish both APP and HTML5. And in 2012, the industry launched the first large-scale HTML5 game "Crazy Snowball" in real-time interactive battle with multiple people on the same screen, and in 2013, the industry's first large-scale card strategy HTML5 game "Godfather of the Upper Bar" (formerly known as "Meow, Meow, Three Kingdoms"), which was released simultaneously with APP. And it has achieved good business results. In 2014, we completed the test version of the first heavy action HTML5 game "Hunting Blade 2", which proves that the technology and quality of HTML5 game has reached the level of APP quality.



Until the launch of LayaFlash Open Source Engine in 2015, Layabox's predecessor engine, LAYA, was in the stage of an open source self-use engine.
