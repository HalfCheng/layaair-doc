#What is HTML5?

###Narrow sense HTML5

In the eyes of technology brothers, HTML5 is the fifth major revision of the new standard of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). After eight years of hard work, the World Wide Web Alliance announced on October 29, 2014 that the HTML5 standard specification was finally developed. Over the past few years, many developers have used some of HTML5 technologies. Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari 4+, Internet Explorer 9+, all of which support HTML5. What they see after the announcement is the "official version".



###Generalized HTML5

In the eyes of more people, HTML5 refers to a browser-based web technology product, which is a kind of web product or game without downloading and installing. HTML5 is usually referred to as H5. Although many people do not think HTML5 is the same as H5, in fact, HTML5 is called H5, which occupies the mainstream of media and HTML5 practitioners.



###Hot little games

In 2018, wechat games broke out. This is not only the emergence of monthly flow products of tens of millions and billions, but also the crazy influx of developers and the rapid growth of products. At the same time, it has also led to the development of profit-making model of cashing in games by advertising fees.

It also allows most developers who are less likely to make money on purchases within the game to have a chance to concentrate on making fun games and to cash in traffic while gaining the recognition of the vast number of players.

In addition, it also stimulated Baidu, mobile QQ, millet, OPPO ViVO and other mainstream platforms to join the small game camp. It's very hot.

But is the game H5? No, not too.

Although the game also has a point-and-play feature, compatible with most Canvas and Webgl interfaces without downloading and installing, it is not standard HTML5. For example, the running environment of Wechat games is not browser, nor can it run in browser, but Runtime running in Wechat APP.

However, LayaAir engine can be adapted to these small game platforms. At present, it has adapter libraries for Weixin small game, Baidu small game and QQ light game. So, using LayaAir engine, developers can not only develop HTML5 games, but also publish them as APP games (LayaAir engine), and also adapt to various small game platforms.
