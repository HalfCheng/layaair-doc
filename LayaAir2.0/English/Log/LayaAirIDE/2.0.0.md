#Beta logs
###Beta1
​

After a year's preparation, we finally ushered in the 2.0 beta version. Beginning with 2.0, besides continuing to focus on performance, we have made further efforts in improving engine functions, ease of use and scalability. 2D has made a lot of improvements, added component support, built-in physical system, realized visual physical editing, 3D has been greatly upgraded, and its performance and functions have been greatly improved. Up to now, Native runtime has also brought a leap in performance, while supporting 3D acceleration, as well as more than 200 other detailed improvements. The main improvements are as follows:

#2D

One**Built-in physical system**

LayaAir 1.0 supports Matter physical engine, but it is simple support, no deep integration, and is not easy to use intuitively. With the opening of small games, more and more games need the support of physical engine, so starting from 2.0, we built-in box 2 D physical engine, encapsulated physical components, provided visual editing of physical attributes of IDE, so that making physical games more convenient and fast. The reason why the physical engine changed from Matter to box2d is that Matter is not very precise and has no penetration-proof support. There are some inexplicable problems when making some kinds of games, and box2d is more perfect than box2d.

​

Two**Componentized support**

1.0 We provide simple script extension support. With the increasing number of users and the increasing complexity of requirements, expansion becomes a common requirement. In order to improve the experience of this requirement, we have added the support of componentized script. If the default component provided by the government can not meet the requirement, we can improve the function of the component by script extension, so as to realize the personalized requirement. Component development is also helpful in functional abstraction, reuse and efficiency improvement. At the same time, we keep the way of inheritance of page base class, which is very convenient when dealing with UI logic.

Comparing with page inheritance, if it is page-level logic, script needs frequent access to multiple elements in the page, using inheritance writing method, and if it is a small independent module with single function and reuse, it is recommended to use script method to achieve.

For more documentation on component support, see https://ldc2.layabox.com/doc/?Nav=zh-as-2-4-0.

​

Three**Scene-based management**

2.0 We provide scenario-based management, developers only need to pay attention to the creative design of the scenario, the remaining scenario loading, switching, resource loading, Atlas usage, resource destruction and so on, the engine provides a complete solution, the original need to do the main process, now the engine also provides, simplifies the development costs, so that we spend more time on game design. 。

​![wuli](imgs/changjing.jpg)

​

Four**Definitible compilation and debugging**

2.0 We use gulp automated script to build the compilation and testing process. The whole compilation and debugging process can be connected in series by script tasks. If you want to insert custom new processes, such as copy, compression, etc. between compilation and debugging, you only need to add a new task in gulp file, so that you can customize and intellectualize each project.

At the same time, the engine supports require by default, so that a large number of third-party nodejs libraries can be used directly in the engine.

At the same time, it improved the debugging method of WeChat game. It can debug and debug at the same time.

In subsequent versions, the release panel will also be reconstructed by scripting customization, so that personalized requirements can be released without worrying.

​

Five**3D editor**

Beginning with 2.0, IDE has added support for editing 3D projects, which can edit 3D scenes, materials, physics and other functions in IDE.

The test version is not open for use for the time being, as improvements are still under way.

​![wuli](imgs/3d.jpg)

​

Six**New layacloud project**

LayaCloud Game Server Cluster is based on the rapid development of multiplayer game design, with high reliability and easy expansion as the primary goal, to simplify the cost of server development. For more information, see https://wiki.cloud.layabox.com./



   ![wuli](imgs/cloud.jpg)

​

Seven**Brand new IDE**

2.0 We redesigned the skin and layout of IDE to make it more concise and beautiful. At the same time, we made a lot of functional improvements to further improve ease of use and development efficiency, so that we can hold a meeting in actual use.

#3D

One**performance**
As we all know, LayaAir has always been famous for its performance. In addition to many enhancements and improvements in functionality and ease of use, LayaAir3D 2.0 has made significant improvements in performance. A lot of reconfiguration and upgrading of the underlying layer have been done, and a lot of optimization has been done for both static and dynamic models, especially for the performance of static scenes. At the same time, more advanced mechanisms are adopted to reduce the number of calls to JS and WebGL local interfaces to improve performance.

Two**Material system**
LayaAir 2.0 has made many improvements and improvements in materials, and has provided more official materials in the engine and opened up more functions related to custom materials. The main new official materials include PBRStandard Material, PBRSpecularMaterial and UnlitMaterial materials. PBR material is also a popular physical rendering material in recent years, using a more scientific shader algorithm to show a more realistic sense of material. UnlitMaterial is a simplified version of illumination-free material, which is generally used for skill effects, etc. Many special effects can be achieved by adding colors or transparent mixing combined with rigid animation. In the aspect of customizing Shader, we mainly add multi-pass functions, such as the edge effect needed for cartoon rendering, and multi-pass renders many times during shader rendering. Material opens the renderQueue interface, renderqueue is the sorting basis when rendering wizards. Developers can modify the render order of the wizard to which material belongs by specifying the renderQueue value.

1) Adding Shader Multiple Pass Rendering
2) Open renderQueue, developers can customize the rendering order
3) New UnlitMaterial Material
4) Adding Effect Material
5) Added PBRStandard Material Material
6) Adding PBR SpecularMaterial Material Material



 ![wuli](imgs/IMG1.png)

Three**Texture system**
LayaAir2.0 improves the texture function and increases the flexibility and controllability of texture. Mipmap is to generate multilevel theory, format is texture format (such as R8G8B8 and R8G8B8A8), wrapModeU and wrapModeV are texture addressing mode, filter mode is texture filter mode, anisoLevel is anisotropic filter mode. Adding the interface of texture upload pixels, developers can upload custom pixel colors to generate texture. Support GPU texture compression (Android, IOS), specifically ETC, PVR, can significantly reduce the footprint, increase the total amount of game resources, improve the quality of the game.

1) Adding multiple texture parameter configurations (mipmap, format, wrapModeU, wrapModeV, filter mode, anisoLevel)
2) Adding Texture Upload Pixel Interface
3) GPU Texture Compression

Four**Animation system**
LayaAir2.0 has a more perfect animator animation system, which can support more animation attributes, support animation transition fusion, move-over switching is more natural, and avoid flashing phenomenon when two non-coherent actions are switched. Animator supports multi-layer animation mixing, which can separate upper and lower parts of animation, and each layer can control some bones independently. Animator animation is adjusted to real-time interpolation, which can greatly reduce memory and improve animation fluency performance at the same frame rate.

1) New Animator Animation Fusion Function CroFade
2) Multilayer Mixed Play of New Animation
3) The animation update mechanism is adjusted to real-time interpolation, which greatly reduces memory and animation fluency performance.
4) Adding animation with multiple material attributes



 ![wuli](imgs/IMG2.png)

Five**physical system**
LayaAir 1.0 has very few physical functions. 2.0 focuses on the physical system reconfiguration design. A variety of new physical components are added, including rigidbody, physicscollider, and charactercontroller. Developers can select different physical components according to project requirements. Adding multiple Shapes, developers can add one or more Shapes to describe the outline of physical components at will.

1) New Rigid Body: Rigid Body
2) New Collider: Physics Collider
3) New role controller: Character Controller
4) New Collider Shape: Box Collider Shape, Capsule Collider Shape, Compound Collider Shape, Cone Collider Shape, Cylinder Collider Shape, Sphere Collider Shape, Mesh Collider Shape
5) Additional auxiliary detection functions: shapeCast, shapeCastAll, etc.

Six**Spirit**
New trailing elves are added to achieve the stretching effect of trailing. The commonly used three-dimensional effects are particle, Mesh and rigid animation, and the new trailing in this 2.0. At the same time, we added the Pixel Line Wizard to draw the Pixel Line Frame. This general re-game or some debugging mode in the development process is more useful.

1) New TrailSprite3D
2) New Pixel Line Sprite 3D

     ![wuli](imgs/IMG3.jpg)

Seven**Script system**
LayaAir2.0 attaches great importance to the improvement of engine usability. Many callback functions are added to the script, including feedback callback of collision, mouse pickup of three-dimensional model, which is more convenient. Specifically onCollisonXX is triggered during physical collision, including entry collision, keeping collision and exit collision. We have provided the onTriigger XX function in the later version of 1.0.

1) Add onCollision Enter, onCollision Stay, onCollision Exit, onMouseDown, onMouseDrag, onMouseClick, onMouseUp, onMouseEnter, onMouseOver, onMouseOut collision callback functions.

Eight**Other**
In LayaAir 1.0, resource release has always been a headache for developers. In LayaAir 2.0, we officially used destroy Unused Resources () to simulate GC releasing unused resources from the current scenario tree species. LayaAir2.0 optimizes the display of illumination maps, making the display of HDR color maps larger than 1.0 more realistic.

1) New batch resource release function
2) Increase HDR Illumination Mapping Format
