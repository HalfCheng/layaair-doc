#Laya Native 2.0.1

Modify bug
1. Modify JS to call ObjectC function, in some cases crash bug. (Modified LayNative underlying code)
2. Modify bugs that have no effect on LayaNative by using tail effect in 3D projects. (Modified LayaAir Engine Code)
3. Modify the 2D project using cacheAs= "bitmap", in some cases, show the wrong bug. (Modified LayaAir Engine Code)
4. Streamlining the special code of LayaNative integration in LayaAir to make the code more concise. (Modified LayaAir Engine Code)

Be careful:
1. Due to the recent update of the chrome version to 69, it is impossible to set breakpoint debugging manually in LayaNative environment due to debugging JS on the real machine.
Developers can debug by writing debuggers in their code.
Install a version of Chrome 68 for debugging.
2. Because of the update of the new Android SDK, the APK of the tester can not be updated automatically. Developers need to delete the APK manually and download it again.

Our engine group will solve this problem as soon as possible, which will cause inconvenience to you. Please forgive me.
